# Stock Analysis with VBA

##Overview of Project

###Purpose
	The purpose of this project was to analyze stock data and gather each stocks trading volumes and returns over the given year. I created a VBA script to automate this process for Steve. I also added in some formatting techniques to make the findings more reader friendly.

## Results

***Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.***

Overall, 2017 was a better performing year for these 12 stocks. In 2017, 11 out of the 12 stocks produced a positive return while only 2 of the 12 had positive returns in 2018. The average stock return for the 12 stocks in 2017 was 67.3% and the average return in 2018 was -8.5%. While the volumes were similar, 2017 was a much more successfull year based on the given data. I have included the analysis for both 2017 and 2018 below.
